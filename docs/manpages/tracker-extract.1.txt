tracker-extract(1)
==================

== NAME

tracker-extract - Extract metadata from a file.

== SYNOPSYS

*tracker extract* _FILE_

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker extract* reads the file provided and extracts any metadata it
can from this file, then displays the metadata on standard output.

The metadata is displayed as a SPARQL update command, that can be run
against a SPARQL endpoint to update its copy of the metadata.

The actual extraction is done by a separate process. This is done to
isolate the calling process from any memory leaks or crashes in the
libraries Tracker uses to extract metadata.

For more information see the libtracker-extract reference documentation.

== OPTIONS

*-v, --verbosity=<__LEVEL__>*::
  This sets the log verbosity for the extractor process.

The possible _LEVEL_ options are:

___________________________________________________________________
路 _debug_ - Show EVERYTHING, from debug messages to errors.

路 _detailed_ - Show enough detail to understand what is happening.

路 _minimal_ - Show an overview of what is going on

路 _errors_ - Show only warnings, criticals, errors or fatal events.
___________________________________________________________________

*-o, --output-format=<__FORMAT__>*::
  Choose which format to use to output results. Supported formats are
  _sparql_, _turtle_ and _json-ld_.

== EXAMPLES

Using command line to extract metadata from a file:::

$ tracker extract /path/to/some/file.mp3

== ENVIRONMENT

*TRACKER_EXTRACTORS_DIR*::
  This is the directory which tracker uses to load the shared libraries
  from (used for extracting metadata for specific file types). These are
  needed on each invocation of tracker-store. If unset it will default
  to the correct place. This is used mainly for testing purposes. The
  default location is /usr/lib/tracker-1.0/extract-modules/.
*TRACKER_EXTRACTOR_RULES_DIR*::
  This is the directory which tracker uses to load the rules files from.
  The rules files describe extractor modules and their supported MIME
  types. The default location is /usr/share/tracker/extract-rules/.
*TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES*::
  Don't use GSettings, instead use a config file similar to how settings
  were saved in 0.10.x. That is, a file which is much like an .ini file.
  These are saved to $HOME/.config/tracker/
