tracker-extract(1)
==================

== NAME

tracker-extract - Extract metadata from a file.

== SYNOPSYS

*tracker extract* _FILE_

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker extract* reads the file provided and extracts any metadata it
can from this file, then displays the metadata on standard output.

The metadata is displayed as a SPARQL update command, that can be run
against a SPARQL endpoint to update its copy of the metadata.

The actual extraction is done by a separate process. This is done to
isolate the calling process from any memory leaks or crashes in the
libraries Tracker uses to extract metadata.

For more information see the libtracker-extract reference documentation.

___________________________________________________________________
