.TH tracker-index 1 "September 2014" GNU "User Commands"

.SH NAME
tracker-index \- Index content using the Tracker filesystem miner

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtracker index\fR <\fIPATH\fR> [[\fIPATH\fR] ...]
\fBtracker index\fR [\-\-monitor] <\fIDIR\fR> [[\fIDIR\fR] ...]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command causes the Tracker filesystem miner to process the given
files or directories.

Content added using \fBtracker index\fR will not be monitored for changes by
default, so you can end up with stale data in your search results.

Use \fB\-\-monitor\fR mode to avoid stale data. In this mode, the command will
not exit until CTRL+C is pressed, and on exit the content will be removed from
the store again.

It's often more convenient to configure the filesystem miner to index your
content automatically, rather than using this command.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-monitor
Trigger indexing and wait for CTRL+C, removing the data again on exit.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR tracker (1).
