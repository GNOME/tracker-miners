.TH tracker-index 1 "September 2014" GNU "User Commands"

.SH NAME
tracker-index \- Index content using the Tracker filesystem miner

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtracker index\fR <\fIpath\fR> [[\fIpath\fR] ...]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This command causes the Tracker filesystem miner to process the given
files or directories.

Usually you should configure the miner to automatically index your
content, because it will monitor the content locations for changes
and ensure that the index is kept up to date. Content that is added
using `tracker index` will not be monitored for changes by default,
so you can end up with stale data in your search results if you use
this command.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR tracker (1).
