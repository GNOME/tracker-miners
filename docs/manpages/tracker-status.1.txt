=================

== NAME

tracker-status - Provide status and statistics on the data indexed

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker status
tracker status --stat [-a] [[expression1]...]
tracker status --collect-debug-info
....

== DESCRIPTION

Display the status of the current index and data set.

With the *--stat* option, displays statistics about the RDF classes and
how many of each exist for data set that has been indexed. For example,
"10 Folders".

This command also provides a way to collect information for debug
purposes using the *--collect-debug-info* option.

== OPTIONS

*--stat[=__expression__]*::
  By default, only common and useful classes are shown, e.g.
  "nfo:Document" or "nfo:Folder", for a full set of statistics, see the
  *--all* option.

If one or more _expression_ arguments is given, the statistics returned
are filtered to only show information those RDF types matching
_expression_ (case folded and matching accented variants). The RDF
classes are detailed by the Nepomuk otology specification. A list of
possible classes matching _expression_, see *tracker sparql -c*.

*-a, --all*::
  Display statistics about ALL RDF classes that exist in the database.
  Without this option only the common RDF classes will be shown, for
  example "nfo:Document" and "nfo:FileDataObject".

This option is implied if search terms are provided to filter ALL
possible statistics.

*--collect-debug-info*::
  Useful when debugging problems to diagnose the state of Tracker on
  your system. The data is output to stdout. Useful if bugs are filed
  against the project itself.

Data collected includes Tracker version in use, disk space available,
size of the databases on the disk, the configuration in use, states of
the index (e.g. last filesystem crawl, data set locale, etc.) and
finally statistics about the data in the database (e.g. how many
"nfo:FileDataObject" resources exist).
