.SH NAME
tracker-search \- Search for content by type or across all types

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtracker search\fR [\fIoptions\fR...] [[\fIexpression1\fR] ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tracker search
searches all indexed content for \fIexpression\fR. The resource in
which \fIexpression\fR matches must exist (see 
.B \-\-all
for more information). All results are returned in ascending order. In
all cases, if no \fIexpression\fR is given for an argument (like 
.B \-\-folders
for example) then ALL items in that category are returned instead.
.TP
\fIexpression\fR
One or more terms to search. The default operation is a logical AND.
For logical OR operations, see -r.

.TP
.B \-l, \-\-limit\fR=<\fIlimit\fR>
Limit search to \fIlimit\fR results. The default is 10 or 512 with \-\-disable\-snippets.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-offset\fR=<\fIoffset\fR>
Offset the search results by \fIoffset\fR. For example, start at item number 10
in the results. The default is 0.
.TP

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-detailed
Show the unique URN associated with each search result. This does not
apply to \-\-music\-albums and \-\-music\-artists.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
Show results which might not be available. This might bebecause a
removable media is not mounted for example. Without this option,
resources are only shown if they exist. This option applies to all
command line switches except
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-snippets
Results are shown with snippets. Snippets are context around the word
that was searched for in the first place. This gives some idea of if
the resource found is the right one. Snippets require Full Text Search
to be compile time enabled AND to not be disabled with
\-\-disable\-fts. Using \-\-disable\-snippets only shows the resources
which matched, no context is provided about where the match occurred.
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-fts
If Full Text Search (FTS) is available, this option allows it to be
disabled for one off searches. This returns results slightly
using particular properties to match the search terms (like "nie:title")
instead of looking for the search terms amongst ALL properties. It is
more limiting to do this, but sometimes searching without FTS can
yield better results if the FTS ranking is off.
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-color
This disables any ANSI color use on the command line. By default this
is enabled to make it easier to see results.
