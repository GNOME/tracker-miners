tracker-miner-fs(1)
===================

== NAME

tracker-miner-fs - Used to crawl the file system to mine data.

== SYNOPSIS

*tracker-miner-fs* [_OPTION_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*tracker-miner-fs* is not supposed to be run by the user since it is
started by its .desktop file when the user logs in. It can also be
started manually of course for debugging purposes. You can not run more
than one instance of this at the same time.

*tracker-miner-fs* mines information about applications and files only.

== OPTIONS

*-?, --help*::
  Show summary of options.
*-V, --version*::
  Returns the version of this binary.
*-v, --verbosity=\{0|1|2|3}*::
  Sets the logging level, 0=errors, 1=minimal, 2=detailed, 3=debug.
*-s, --initial-sleep=SECONDS*::
  Sets the initial sleep time before crawling the file system is
  started. If the *--no-daemon* option is used, this option is ignored.
*-n, --no-daemon*::
  Tells the miner to exit once all indexing has finished and the
  database is up to date. This is not the default mode of operation for
  the miner, usually it stays around acting like a daemon to monitor
  file updates which may occur over time. This option renders the
  *--initial-sleep* option moot.
*-e, --eligible=FILE*::
  Checks if *FILE* is eligible for being mined based on the current
  configuration rules. In addition to this, it will check if *FILE*
  would be monitored for changes. This works with non-existing *FILE*
  arguments as well as existing *FILE* arguments.

== ENVIRONMENT

*TRACKER_USE_LOG_FILES*::
  Don't just log to stdout and stderr, but to log files too which are
  kept in $HOME/.local/share/tracker/. This came into effect in 0.15.3
  and 0.16.0. After this version of Tracker, logging to file (usually
  useful for debugging) can only be done by declaring this environment
  variable.
*TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES*::
  Don't use GSettings, instead use a config file similar to how settings
  were saved in 0.10.x. That is, a file which is much like an .ini file.
  These are saved to $HOME/.config/tracker/
