== NAME

tracker-index - List, pause, resume and command data miners indexing
content

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker index --reindex-mime-type <mime1> [[-m [mime2]] ...]
tracker index --file <file1> [[file2] ...]
tracker index --import <file1> [[file2] ...]
tracker index --backup <file> | --restore <file>
....

== DESCRIPTION

This command perform actions on the current index. The "index" holds a
snapshot of the working tree in a database.

The index command allows some level of control on existing data indexed,
such as re-indexing content from a specific demographic - e.g. all JPEG
images, or simply reindexing an existing or non-existent file.

It may be a good idea to backup your index before an upgrade in case
there is data loss (which should never happen). In those cases, the
backup command is made available and of course the restore command will
import an older data set (or index) into an empty index.

Finally, there is an import feature which makes testing or applying a
"base" data set for use much easier.

== OPTIONS

*-m, --reindex-mime-type=<__mime1__> [[-m [_mime2_]] ...]*::
  Re-index files which match the _mime_ type supplied. This is usually
  used when installing new extractors which support _mime_ types
  previously unsupported. This forces Tracker to re-index those files.
  You can use *--reindex-mime-type* more than once per _mime_ type.
*-f, --index=<__file1__> [[_file2_] ...]*::
  (Re)index a file matching the _file_ name(s) supplied.
*-b, --backup=<__file__>*::
  Begins backing up the Tracker databases and save it to the _file_
  given.
*-o, --restore=<__file__>*::
  Begins restoring a previous backup from the _file_ which points to the
  location of the backup generated by *--backup*.
*i, --import=<__file1__> [[_file2_] ...]*::
  Allows data to be imported into the index / database by providing
  files with Turtle content.

Multiple _file_ arguments can be provided to import data from multiple
files.

The _file_ argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also does
not have to be an absolute path.
