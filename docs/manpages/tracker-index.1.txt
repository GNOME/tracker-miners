== NAME

tracker-index - Index content using the Tracker filesystem miner

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker index <PATH> [[PATH] ...]
tracker index [--monitor] <DIR> [[DIR] ...]
....

== DESCRIPTION

This command causes the Tracker filesystem miner to process the given
files or directories.

Content added using *tracker index* will not be monitored for changes by
default, so you can end up with stale data in your search results.

Use *--monitor* mode to avoid stale data. In this mode, the command will
not exit until CTRL+C is pressed, and on exit the content will be
removed from the store again.

It's often more convenient to configure the filesystem miner to index
your content automatically, rather than using this command.

== OPTIONS

*--no-wait*::
  Exit as soon as the files are queued for indexing. Errors during
  processing will not be reported in this mode.
*-m, --monitor*::
  Trigger indexing and wait for CTRL+C, removing the data again on exit.
