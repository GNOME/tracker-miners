== NAME

tracker-index - Index content using the Tracker filesystem miner

== SYNOPSIS

....
tracker index <path> [[path] ...]
....

== DESCRIPTION

This command causes the Tracker filesystem miner to process the given
files or directories.

Usually you should configure the miner to automatically index your
content, because it will monitor the content locations for changes and
ensure that the index is kept up to date. Content that is added using
`tracker index` will not be monitored for changes by default, so you can
end up with stale data in your search results if you use this command.
